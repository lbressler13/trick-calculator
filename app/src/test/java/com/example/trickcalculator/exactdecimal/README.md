# ExactDecimal Tests

This folder contains tests for all classes within the **exactdecimal** package, including **Expression** and **Term** in addition to **ExactDecimal**.
Due to the large number of files, the tests are split into sub-folders based on class and/or functionality.
However, all tests should be in the package
**com.example.trickcalculator.exactdecimal**
regardless of location in the test folder structure, because they test code within that package.
